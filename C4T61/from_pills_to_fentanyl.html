                                pain pills, heroin and fentanyl. As of 2018, the crisis had claimed more than 400,000

                                    Overdose deaths from prescription drug abuse began to surge in the 1990s as usage
                                    expanded, with the advent of new philosophies about pain management and
                                    more-aggressive marketing techniques by drug companies. By 2011, more than 115,000
                                    Americans had died.

                            <p>Dominic Rosa was 6 years old when he first tried out for hockey in 1989. He didn’t have
                                the proper equipment and padding, so he looked smaller than the other players,
                                remembered his father, Charles Rosa, 60. Dominic grasped onto the sides of the rink with
                                his mittens, trying not to fall over. Charles thought about hauling him out of the
                                arena. But another father told him to wait it out.

                                Dominic wasn’t a quitter, though. He went on to play as a forward for more than 10
                                years, becoming a co-captain of the Peabody High School team and getting picked for the
                                regional all-star team. But he couldn’t beat opioids.
                            <p>
                                “Now, a lot of the people that my sons grew up with are struggling,” Charles said. “It’s
                                unbelievable how many of those kids are dead or struggling.”

                                Eric Pavona was an honors student. He got a 32 on his ACT. He worked two jobs in high
                                school, saving enough money to buy a used, silver 2005 Mustang. He was studying to be a
                                pharmacist.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, around 2008, he became addicted to heroin. “He turned into a totally different
                                human being, like a Martian,” said his father, Phil Pavona, 62, who is a retired
                                hospital administrative director.

                                Eric accrued debt, he dropped out of college, he lied. </p>
                            <p>
                                At first, Phil was clueless. Spoons would go missing from their kitchen and Phil would
                                wonder whether someone was throwing them out.

                                It wasn’t until Phil went to the courthouse after Eric told him he had a ticket that he
                                found out Eric actually had a drug charge. That began a 2½-year battle within the
                                family.

                            </p>
                            <p>Phil felt adrift. They were a middle-class family in Lansing, Mich. He didn’t feel like
                                there was anyone else in their community who could relate.
                                “I watched the news,” Phil said. “It wasn’t in the news.”
                                After being released from jail, Eric overdosed but survived. Three people released with
                                Eric had overdosed and died shortly afterward. A clerk at the jail told Phil he was
                                lucky.
                                “I didn’t feel lucky,” Phil said. “It was disheartening. I remember saying to her, ‘But
                                why didn’t you warn us?’ ”
                                Phil said he didn’t realize addicts tend to quickly relapse after being released. He
                                thought his son would want to go home, relax and watch TV.
                            </p>
                            <p>On Aug. 12, 2011, Eric was released from jail again. Two weeks later, he died. He was 25.

                                Starting in 2015, people on the Cherokee reservation in western North Carolina were
                                dying, and Kallup McCoy worried for his sister.

                                Kallup had entered recovery after getting out of jail for a drug-related charge in 2017.
                                His sister, Leighann Rose McCoy, was in the throes of her opioid addiction. Kallup
                                called her repeatedly, telling her to get help before she made her four children
                                motherless. “She finally stopped answering my calls,” he said.

                            </p>
                            <p>Kallup said he and Leighann grew up surrounded by a drug culture. Several family members
                                were marijuana and cocaine dealers.

                                “It was so normalized,” he said.

                                Although Kallup and Leighann had used marijuana, he said, they became addicted to harder
                                drugs only after they were given pain medication. He first tried opioids in 1998 when he
                                was given Stadol, a brand of the morphine-like opioid butorphanol, for migraines.

                                She was treated with Percocet, which contains oxycodone, for scoliosis after leaving the
                                Navy in 2007.
