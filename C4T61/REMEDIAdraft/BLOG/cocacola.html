                            <p>The Coca-Cola Company, American corporation founded in 1892 and today engaged primarily
                                in the manufacture and sale of syrup and concentrate for Coca-Cola, a sweetened
                                carbonated beverage that is a cultural institution in the United States and a global
                                symbol of American tastes. The company also produces and sells other soft drinks and
                                citrus beverages. With more than 2,800 products available in more than 200 countries,
                                Coca-Cola is the largest beverage manufacturer and distributor in the world and one of
                                the largest corporations in the United States. Headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia.
                            </p>
                            <p>The drink Coca-Cola was originated in 1886 by an Atlanta pharmacist, John S. Pemberton
                                (1831–88), at his Pemberton Chemical Company. His bookkeeper, Frank Robinson, chose the
                                name for the drink and penned it in the flowing script that became the Coca-Cola
                                trademark. Pemberton originally touted his drink as a tonic for most common ailments,
                                basing it on cocaine from the coca leaf and caffeine-rich extracts of the kola nut; the
                                cocaine was removed from Coca-Cola’s formula in about 1903. Pemberton sold his syrup to
                                local soda fountains, and, with advertising, the drink became phenomenally successful.
                                By 1891 another Atlanta pharmacist, Asa Griggs Candler (1851–1929), had secured complete
                                ownership of the business (for a total cash outlay of $2,300 and the exchange of some
                                proprietary rights), and he incorporated the Coca-Cola Company the following year. The
                                trademark “Coca-Cola” was registered in the U.S. Patent Office in 1893.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Under Candler’s leadership, sales rose from about 9,000 gallons of syrup in 1890 to
                                370,877 gallons in 1900. Also during that decade, syrup-making plants were established
                                in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, and the product came to be sold in every U.S.
                                state and territory as well as in Canada. In 1899 the Coca-Cola Company signed its first
                                agreement with an independent bottling company, which was allowed to buy the syrup and
                                produce, bottle, and distribute the Coca-Cola drink. Such licensing agreements formed
                                the basis of a unique distribution system that now characterizes most of the American
                                soft-drink industry. Capitalized at $100,000 in 1892 upon incorporation, the Coca-Cola
                                Company was sold in 1919 for $25 million to a group of investors led by Atlanta
                                businessman Ernest Woodruff. His son, Robert Winship Woodruff, guided the company as
                                president and chairman for more than three decades (1923–55).
                            </p>
                            <p>The post-World War II years saw diversification in the packaging of Coca-Cola and the
                                development or acquisition of new products. The trademark “Coke,” first used in
                                advertising in 1941, was registered in 1945. In 1946 the company purchased rights to
                                Fanta, a soft drink previously developed in Germany. The contoured Coca-Cola bottle,
                                first introduced in 1916, was registered in 1960. The company also introduced the
                                lemon-lime drink Sprite in 1961 and its first diet cola, sugar-free Tab, in 1963. With
                                its purchase of Minute Maid Corporation in 1960, the company entered the citrus juice
                                market. It added the brand Fresca in 1966.

                                In 1978 Coca-Cola became the only company allowed to sell cold packaged beverages in the
                                People’s Republic of China. In 1982 the company introduced its low-calorie sugar-free
                                soft drink Diet Coke (originally named Diet Coca-Cola). In an effort to address its
                                decline in market share, the company adopted a new flavour of Coca-Cola in April 1985,
                                using a formula it developed through taste tests. New Coke was not well received,
                                however. Owing to the public outcry, Coca-Cola revived its original flavour in July,
                                which was then marketed as Coca-Cola Classic. From 1982 to 1989 the company held a
                                controlling interest in Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., a motion-picture and
                                entertainment company.

                                New markets opened up for Coca-Cola in the early 1990s; the company began selling
                                products in East Germany in 1990 and in India in 1993. In 1992 the company introduced
                                its first bottle made partially from recycled plastic—a major innovation in the industry
                                at the time. Coca-Cola created many new beverages during the 1990s, including the
                                Asia-marketed Qoo children’s fruit drink, Powerade sports drink, and Dasani bottled
                                water. Coca-Cola also acquired Barq’s root beer in the United States; Inca Kola in Peru;
                                Maaza, Thums Up, and Limca in India; and Cadbury Schweppes beverages, which were sold in
                                more than 120 countries across the globe.

                                <br>
                                In the early 2000s Coca-Cola faced allegations of illegal soil and water pollution, as
                                well as allegations of severe human rights violations. In 2001 the United Steelworkers
                                of America and the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) filed a lawsuit against
                                Coca-Cola and Bebidas y Alimentos and Panamerican Beverages, Inc. (also known as Panamco
                                LLC; the primary bottlers of Coca-Cola’s beverages in Latin America), claiming that the
                                defendants had openly engaged so-called “death squads” to intimidate, torture, kidnap,
                                and even murder union officials in Latin America. The controversy gained worldwide
                                attention and led several American universities to ban the sale of Coca-Cola products on
                                their campuses. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.

                                In 2005 the company introduced Coca-Cola Zero, a zero-calorie soft drink with the taste
                                of regular Coca-Cola. In 2007 the company acquired Energy Brands, Inc., along with its
                                variously enhanced waters. That same year Coca-Cola announced that it would join the
                                Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR), a group of companies working
                                together to develop and implement corporate responses to human rights issues that affect
                                the business world.
