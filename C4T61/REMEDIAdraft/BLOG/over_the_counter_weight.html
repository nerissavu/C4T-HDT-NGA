                                There's no magic bullet for losing weight. The most effective way to lose weight and
                                keep it off is by eating a healthy low-calorie diet and being more physically active.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Weight-loss pills — prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, herbal products or other
                                dietary supplements — are all, at best, tools that may help with weight loss. But there
                                is relatively little research about these products. The best studied of these are
                                prescription weight-loss drugs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, a 2016 study reviewed 28 long-term trials of prescription drugs for
                                treating obesity. The researchers concluded that when a person makes appropriate
                                lifestyle changes, a prescription weight-loss drug increases the likelihood of achieving
                                "clinically meaningful" weight loss within a year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clinically meaningful weight loss means you've lost enough weight to lower your risk of
                                heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. This is generally defined as 5 percent or
                                more of body weight.

                                It's important to consider that weight loss achieved in a research setting may be
                                greater than in actual practice. Also, possible side effects and adverse reactions to
                                weight-loss pills can affect how well you might do.
                            </p>
                            <p>It's reasonable to expect that prescription weight-loss pills may be beneficial, but they
                                won't be magical. They don't work for everyone, and the benefits may be modest.
                                Researchers know much less about the potential benefits and risks of over-the-counter
                                weight-loss products.

                                        regulations
                                    </a></b></p>
                            <p>Over-the-counter weight-loss treatments fall into two general categories:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>The standards for regulating the production and marketing of these two types of
                                treatments are different. For a nonprescription drug, such as orlistat (Alli), the drug
                                company must provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with results from human
                                (clinical) trials that show the safety and effectiveness of the drug at the
                                nonprescription dose.
                            </p>
                            <p>The makers of dietary supplements are responsible for ensuring the safety of their
                                product and making honest claims about possible benefits. However, the makers' claims
                                aren't subject to FDA review or approval before marketing. Also, the type or quality of
                                research used to support claims can vary.
                                If the FDA can demonstrate that a supplement is unsafe, the agency can ban the product
                                or ask a manufacturer to withdraw it voluntarily. The FDA may also take action against a
                                manufacturer if there is no evidence at all to support a claim.</p>
                            <p>These differences in research, production and marketing can make it difficult to make
                                informed decisions about products.
                            </p>

                            <p>When a dietary supplement is marketed as "clinically proven" to cause weight loss, there
                                should be some type of clinical evidence to support it. Such a claim, however, provides
                                no details about the clinical research.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, raspberry ketone supplements are marketed as clinically proven, natural
                                weight-loss products. As of December 2017, the results of only one clinical trial with
                                raspberry ketone had been published. The results include the following information:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The eight-week trial used a multi-ingredient supplement with raspberry ketone,
                                    caffeine, bitter orange, ginger root extract and garlic root extract, as well as
                                    other herbs, vitamins and minerals.
                                </li>
                                <li>Seventy obese adults were randomly assigned to receive either the supplement or an
                                    inactive ingredient (placebo).
                                </li>
                                <li>All of the participants were placed on a restricted diet and exercise program.

                                <li>Forty-five people completed all eight weeks of the trial.
                                </li>
                                <li>Among people completing the trial, the average weight loss in the supplement group
                                    was 4.2 pounds (1.9 kilograms).
                                </li>
                                <li>The average weight loss in the placebo group was 0.9 pounds (0.4 kilograms).

                            <p>The weight loss in the treatment group was modest, and the trial was only eight weeks,
                                which isn't long enough to know if the supplement will help with weight loss long term.
                                Plus, the supplement included multiple ingredients, making it impossible to judge which
                                ingredients helped the weight loss.

                                And a product isn't necessarily safe simply because it's natural. Though rare, some

                            <p>Ephedra, or ma-huang, is an herbal stimulant once used in weight-loss products. It's now

                                associated with similar adverse effects. Because of limited research and the use of

                                well-understood.

                            <p>It's important to do your homework if you're thinking about trying over-the-counter
                                weight-loss pills. Information about many dietary supplements is available online from
                                the Office of Dietary Supplements and the National Center for Complementary and
                                Integrative Health.

                            <p>If you're considering weight-loss pills, be sure to talk with your doctor, especially if
                                you have health problems, take prescription drugs, or are pregnant or breast-feeding.
                                It's also important to get advice on possible interactions with your current use of
                                medicine, vitamins or minerals.

                                Your doctor can also offer advice on losing weight, provide support, monitor your
                                progress or refer you to a dietitian.
