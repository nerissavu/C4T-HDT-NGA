                                Female doctors are more likely than other professionals to have children and keep
                                working. The reasons offer lessons for other jobs.

                            <p>
                                Britni Hebert was chief resident, on track for a career in the highly demanding field of
                                oncology, when she found out she was having twins. “Everything kind of just tilted on
                                its head,” she said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She couldn’t imagine 80-hour workweeks with two newborns at home, while her husband was
                                doing an equally intensive radiology fellowship. But she didn’t leave the profession.
                                Instead, Dr. Hebert, 37, decided to practice internal medicine and geriatrics, with more
                                control over her hours. She has been able to change her schedule three times as her
                                family’s needs have changed (the twins are 6, and the couple has a baby), and now works
                                about 85 percent of full-time hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Medicine has become something of a stealth family-friendly profession, at a time when
                                other professions are growing more greedy about employees’ time. Jobs increasingly
                                require long, inflexible hours, and pay disproportionately more to people who work them.
                                But if one parent is on call at work, someone else has to be on call at home. For most
                                couples, that’s the woman — which is why educated women are being pushed out of work or
                                into lower-paying jobs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But medicine has changed in ways that offer doctors and other health care workers the
                                option of more control over their hours, depending on the specialty and job they choose,
                                while still practicing at the top of their training and being paid proportionately.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Women are now half of medical students. In some specialties, like pediatrics, geriatrics
                                and child psychiatry, they are the majority. Female doctors are likelier than women with
                                law degrees, business degrees or doctorates to have children. They’re also much less
                                likely to stop working when they do.
                                <br>
                                Flexible, predictable hours are the key — across occupations — to shrinking gender gaps,
                                according to the body of research by Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard. As
                                American employers struggle to adapt to the realities of modern family life and as
                                younger generations of workers demand more balance, medicine offers a road map.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr. Hebert, who lives in Lafayette, La., estimates that forgoing oncology halved her
                                lifelong earnings. But she’s grateful that she had other options for practicing medicine
                                — and can still meet her children at the school bus most afternoons.
                                <br>
                                “I don’t want to pretend there aren’t sacrifices that come with the path that I’ve
                                chosen,” she said, “but I just don’t think I could be employed at this time if not for
                                being able to decide my schedule.”
                            </p>
                            <div class="post-image">

                                Most of what changed in medicine had little to do with making it easier for parents,
                                especially women, to work; family friendliness was a happy consequence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A generation ago, the typical doctor owned a private practice, and saw patients whenever
                                they got sick. Today, doctors are much likelier to work for large group practices or
                                hospitals and be on call at predictable times. Seventy percent of doctors under 40 are
                                now employees, not owners, according to American Medical Association data. So are the
                                majority of female doctors of all ages.
                                <br>
                                Large group practices are more profitable because they can share resources, like clinic
                                space or physician assistants, and more easily negotiate with health insurance plans.
                                <br>
                                But the setup also gives doctors more work-life balance, because there are more people
                                who can serve as substitutes and divide night and weekend work.
                                <br>
                                “The old market expectation that your doctor will be available at all hours and is
                                entirely flexible was beginning to fall apart as the work force became more diverse,”
                                said Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of
                                California, San Francisco. “New generations look at the work-life balance of older
                                generations of physicians, and I think many of them say, ‘I don’t want that.’”
                                <br>
                                Dr. Wachter was responsible for naming one of the jobs that exemplifies this shift:
                                hospitalist, the physician who sees patients who are hospitalized and coordinates with
                                the specialists caring for them. They also make doctors’ schedules predictable, because
                                hospitalists work in shifts, and primary care physicians don’t have to go to the
                                hospital when their patients do. Other occupations have also come to rely on
                                substitutes, like pharmacists and real estate agents (and in rare cases, some lawyers
                                and management consultants).
                                <br>
                                Sara Gonzalez, 37, a pediatrician in Dartmouth, Mass., works as a hospitalist and in the
                                emergency department, another shift job. She usually works 10 eight-hour shifts a month,
                                with a few 16-hour overnights. When she’s off, she’s responsible for anything that comes
                                up with her 1-year-old daughter; when she’s at the hospital, her wife, who works in
                                marketing, is the on-call parent.
